After the combinational flurry ending on move 23, it was too easy to reach for the script that was titled \"And White converts his material advantage\". However, that account had to be shelved hastily as Kramnik emphatically showed the virtues of Black's position, rapidly attaining at least equality, then having some pressure, and finally seeing Leko go astray in a much simplified ending where the best White could hope for was a draw. A marvellously dramatic encounter and a fine riposte to critics who thought the match would be dull. In the press conference after the game, Kramnik looked drained, Leko cheerful and phlegmatic. Kramnik insisted throughout that the position objectively is drawn, and pulled many sceptical faces when describing his win. The following day, both players remarked how hard it is to move on from such a battle, Kramnik musing \"I tried to get the two rooks out of my mind, and to stop trying to coordinate them in different attacking patterns. I think it was four o'clock in the morning when I was able to sleep.\" Leko added, \"I needed until five a.m. to get rid of those two black rooks.\" } 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 {The Petroff Defence was originally designed as an equaliser, but it also gives Black dynamic counterchances.} 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5 6.Bd3 Nc6 {This move order has supplanted the ancient debate between Bd6 and Be7.} (6...Bd6) (6...Be7) 7.O-O Be7 8.c4 Nb4 {As we shall see, the Petroff is a defence where Kramnik appears to be equally at home with both White and Black.} 9.Be2 O-O 10.Nc3 Bf5 11.a3 Nxc3 12.bxc3 Nc6 13.Re1 Re8 14.cxd5 Qxd5 15.Bf4 Rac8 16.h3 { is an interesting psychological ploy by Leko, as it was Kramnik's own choice when he played against Anand in Corus 2003.

Even so, it is not obvious that White can reach the safe haven of a draw, as the basic black strategy of piling up with his rooks against the white f-pawn still seems valid. However, with only two pawns each on the board, White can place his g-pawn on g5, so that even if black trades both rooks for queen and f-pawn, the resulting king and pawn ending is a draw.}) 44...g5 45.Qf6 h6 {This is a very clever move from Kramnik, clearly overlooked by Leko, whose last move could have no other purpose than to threaten h6. } (46.Qxh6 R8a6 { and the white queen is trapped. }) 46.f3 R5a6 47.Qc3 Ra4 48.Qc6 R8a6 49.Qe8+ Kg7 50.Qb5 R4a5 51.Qb4 Rd5 52.Qb3 Rad6 53.Qc4 Rd3 54.Kf2 Ra3 55.Qc5 Ra2+ 56.Kg3 Rf6 57.Qb4 Raa6 58.Kg2 Rf4 {Black weaves a net inexorably around White's sorry f-pawn.} 59.Qb2+ Raf6 60.Qe5 Rxf3 {Kramnik's manoeuvres, though lengthy, have finally triumphed.
