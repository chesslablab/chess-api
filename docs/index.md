PHP Chess API is a REST-like API that provides chess functionality over an HTTP connection. It goes hand in hand with a MySQL chess database which is to be set up as per the [Chess Data](https://chesslablab.github.io/chess-data/) docs.

Similar to the [PHP Chess Server](https://chesslablab.github.io/chess-server/), it can be hosted on a custom domain. However, while the chess server handles multiple concurrent connections based on real-time commands, the API endpoints may take a little longer to execute â€” for example, a database query.

## Components Based Design

PHP Chess API has been created using the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework, which is a set of reusable PHP components.

## Lightweight

Dependencies required:

- PHP Chess for chess functionality.
- PHP dotenv for loading environment variables.
